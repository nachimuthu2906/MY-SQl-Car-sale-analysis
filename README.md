# Car Sales Analysis Project

This repository contains an analysis of car sales data using **MySQL**. The project includes SQL queries for data manipulation and analysis, as well as a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the insights gained from the analysis.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze car sales data to extract insights regarding:
- Total number of manufacturers
- Average vehicle sales by manufacturer
- Highest-priced vehicles
- Vehicles priced above the average price
- Manufacturers with vehicles below the average price
- Comparison of average horsepower between original and duplicate tables

The project uses various **SQL operations** such as:
- Basic Queries
- Subqueries
- Joins
- Advanced Queries (Group By, Aggregate Functions)

  
## Files in This Repository

1. **car_sales_project.sql**: Contains all the SQL queries used for analyzing the car sales data.
2. 
3. **car_sales_project.pptx**: A PowerPoint presentation that provides a visual summary of the analysis, including steps to export data from Excel to SQL, and examples of queries performed.

## Key SQL Operations

- **Basic Queries**: Retrieve counts, averages, and other statistics.
- **Subqueries**: Execute complex queries that rely on other queries.
- **Joins**: Combine data from original and duplicate tables for in-depth analysis.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Perform calculations like sum, average, and count to gain insights into the data.
